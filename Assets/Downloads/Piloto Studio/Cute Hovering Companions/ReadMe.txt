============================


QUICK START
-----------
The default rendering version on this package is HDRP. If you want to upgrade for either URP or Standard rendering pipeline, you may do so by importing the provided unity packages inside the "Upgrades" folder 

If you get script errors on the camera or post process volume, you can either delete them, or get the official unity post process package. (Regarding the preview scene only)

Once you have the right rendering pipeline selected, you can simply choose a companion inside of the "N:\Unity Projects\assetstore-main\Asset Store Build Project\Assets\Piloto Studio\Cute Hovering Companions\Companions" folder and drag it into the scene.

There's also particle version of all companions on the Prefabs folder, with no animations.

Make sure you have the Core RP installed if using HDRP or URP, and Unninstalled if you use Standard. (You can check that on the package manager.)
